# TODO

## General

- Probably don't need to keep defining a total preorder throughout

- Consistency with TD and bipartite tournament chapters:
    - Axiom styling. TD uses uppercase normal text, but tournaments uses bold
      lowercase
    - Use of sectioning. In both we split axioms up according to theme
      (symmetry, independence, monotonicity) but via subsections in TD and
      paragraph headings in tournaments

- Figure out what to do about proof appendices

## TD

- Tikz-ify the figures

## Bipartite tournaments

- Truth discovery reference in the introduction is no longer be appropriate
- There is a commented out table showing axiom satisfaction for the different
  operators. Maybe uncomment it and show it in the text
- Consider using different notation for operators: currently we use Ï† which
  clashes with the logic part
