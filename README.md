# TODO

## General

- Probably don't need to keep defining a total preorder throughout

- Consistency with TD and bipartite tournament chapters:
    - Axiom styling. TD uses uppercase normal text, but tournaments uses bold
      lowercase
    - Use of sectioning. In both we split axioms up according to theme
      (symmetry, independence, monotonicity) but via subsections in TD and
      paragraph headings in tournaments

- Figure out what to do about proof appendices

- Change paper, work etc to chapter, thesis etc

- Change "the appendix" to proper reference

- Proof sketches can be moved out of appendices

- Proofs deferred to the appendix only for space reasons can be moved into the
  body

- Punctuation at the end of display math

## TD

- Tikz-ify the figures

## Bipartite tournaments

- Truth discovery reference in the introduction is no longer be appropriate
- There is a commented out table showing axiom satisfaction for the different
  operators. Maybe uncomment it and show it in the text
- Consider using different notation for operators: currently we use Ï† which
  clashes with the logic part

## Tests

Things to catch from the TeX source:

- Blank line before `\end{proof}`
- Space between punctuation and footnote
- `\begin{proof}[label]` where `label` does not start with "Proof "
- Appearance of the word "paper" (too extreme?)

From parsing compile logs:

- Undefined references and citations
- Other errors
- Warnings

# Open questions

- Sums and Monotonicity in TD chapter
- Operator with chain-min, dual and mon simultaneously in tournament chapter
