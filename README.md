# TODO

## General

- Probably don't need to keep defining a total preorder throughout

- Consistency with TD and bipartite tournament chapters:
    - Use of sectioning. In both we split axioms up according to theme
      (symmetry, independence, monotonicity) but via subsections in TD and
      paragraph headings in tournaments

- Change paper, work etc to chapter, thesis etc

- Punctuation at the end of display math

- Duplicate references in bibliography

- Possible mathematical prerequisites
    * preorders, total preorders, strict parts, max/min
    * 2^X for powerset, Y^X for functions, | for restrictions
    * cycle notation for permutations

- References:
    * `van` for Dutch names

- Consider using `\ref` instead of `\cref`

## Bipartite tournaments

- Truth discovery reference in the introduction is no longer be appropriate

## Tests

From parsing compile logs:

- Undefined references and citations
- Other errors
- Warnings

# New content

## Open questions

- Sums and Monotonicity in TD chapter
- Operator with chain-min, dual and mon simultaneously in tournament chapter
- For expertise models: can closure under arbitrary unions be captured at the
  level of frames?
- KR paper:
    - H-boundedness for our operators
