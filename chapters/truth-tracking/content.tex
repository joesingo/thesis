\chapter{Truth-Tracking}

\section{Introduction}

In this chapter we study truth-tracking in the logical framework of
\textcite{singleton_booth_22_preprint} for reasoning about multiple non-expert
information sources. Broadly speaking, the goal of truth-tracking is to find
the true state of the world given some input which describes it. In our case
this involves finding the true state of some propositional domain about which
the sources give reports, and finding the extent of the expertise of the
sources themselves.

The general problem of truth-tracking has been studied in various forms across
many domains. Perhaps the oldest approach goes back to \textcite{condorcet}, whose
celebrated \emph{Jury Theorem} states that a majority vote on a yes/no issue
will yield the ``correct" answer with probability approaching 1 as the number
of voters tends to infinity, provided that each voter is more reliable than
random choice. This result has since been generalised in many
directions~\textcite{grofman1983thirteen}. More widely, \emph{epistemic social
choice}~\cite{elkind2016rationalizations} studies aggregation methods (e.g.
voting rules) from the point of finding the ``correct" result with high
probability, where individual votes are seen as noisy approximations. Of
particular relevance to our work is truth-tracking in \emph{judgement
aggregation} in social
choice~\cite{hartmann_judgment_2012,TerzopoulouEndrissSAGT2019}, which also
takes place in a logical framework. \emph{Belief merging} has close links with
judgement aggregation, and generalised jury theorems have been found here
too~\cite{everaere_epistemic_2010}.

In crowdsourcing, the problem of \emph{truth discovery}~\cite{li_survey_2016}
looks at how information from unreliable sources can be aggregated to find the
true value of a number of variables, and to find the true reliability level of
the sources. This is close to our setting, since incoming information is not
always assumed to be reliable, and information about the sources themselves is
sought after. Work in this area combines empirical results (e.g. how well
methods find the truth on test datasets for which true values are known) and
theoretical guarantees, and is
typically set in a probabilistic framework.

On the other hand, \emph{formal learning theory}~\cite{jain1999systems} offers
a non-probabilistic view on truth-tracking, stemming from the framework of
\textcite{Gold_1967} for identification in the limit. In this paradigm a learner
receives an infinite sequence of information step-by-step, such that all true
information eventually appears in the sequence. The learner outputs a
hypothesis at each step, and aims to stabilise on the correct hypothesis after
some finite number of steps. This framework has been combined with belief
revision theory~\cite{kelly1997reliable,baltag_tt_2019} and dynamic
epistemic logic~\cite{baltag2019dynamic}.

This is the approach we take, and in particular we adapt the truth-tracking
setting of \textcite{baltag_tt_2019}. We apply this to the logical
framework of \textcite{singleton_booth_22_preprint}. Briefly, this framework
extends finite propositional logic with two new notions: that of a source
having \emph{expertise} on a formula, and a formula being \emph{sound} for a
source to report. Intuitively, expertise on $\phi$ means the source has the
epistemic capability to distinguish between any pair of $\phi$ and $\neg\phi$
states: they know whether or not $\phi$ holds in any state. A formula is sound
for a source if it is true \emph{up to their lack of expertise}. For example,
if a source has expertise on $\phi$ but not $\psi$, then $\phi \land \psi$ is
sound whenever $\phi$ holds, since we can ignore the $\psi$ part (on which the
source has no expertise). The resulting logical language therefore addresses
both the \emph{ontic} facts of the world, through the propositional part, and
the \emph{epistemic} state of the sources, via expertise and soundness.

Generally speaking, formal learning theory supposes that all information
received is true, and that all true information is eventually
received.\footnotemark{} This is not a tenable assumption with non-expert
sources: some sources may simply lack the expertise to know whether $\phi$ is
true or false. Instead we make a different (and strong) assumption: all and
only \emph{sound} reports are received. Thus, sources report everything
consistent with their expertise. This necessitates inconsistent reports from
non-experts, even if we assume sources are rational. Consequently, the input to
our learning methods should be distinguished from the inputs to belief revision
and belief merging methods~\cite{alchourron1985logic,konieczny2002merging} --
also propositional formulas -- which represent \emph{beliefs} of the reporting
sources. Indeed, we do not model beliefs of the sources at all.

\footnotetext{
    \textcite{baltag_tt_2019} consider erroneous reports, but only
    provided that all errors are eventually corrected.
}

The following example informally illustrates the core concepts of the logical
framework and truth-tracking, and will be returned to throughout the chapter.

\begin{example}
    \label{ex_informal_example}

    Consider a medical scenario in which patient $\patientA{}$ is checked for
    conditions $p$ and $q$. By examining $\patientA{}$, a doctor
    $\dr{}$ has expertise to determine whether $\patientA{}$ has at least one
    of $p$ or $q$, but cannot tell which one(s) without a blood test. A test is
    only available for $p$, however, so that the technician $\tech{}$
    performing the test has expertise on $p$ but not $q$.

    Supposing $\patientA{}$ in fact suffers from $q$ but not $p$, $\dr{}$
    considers each of $p \land q$, $\neg p \land q$ and $p \land \neg q$
    possible, whereas $\tech{}$ considers both $\neg p \land q$ and $\neg p
    \land \neg q$ possible.
    %
    Assuming both sources report \emph{all} they consider possible, their
    combined expertise leaves $\neg p \land q$ as the only
    possibility. Intuitively, this means we \emph{can} find the true values of
    $p$ and $q$ in this case.

    Now consider a patient $\patientB{}$ who suffers from both conditions.
    $\dr{}$ cannot distinguish $\patientA{}$ and $\patientB{}$, so will provide
    the same reports, and $\tech{}$ considers both $p \land q$ and $p \land
    \neg q$ possible. In this case $\tech{}$ is more knowledgable than $\dr{}$
    -- since they consider fewer situations possible -- but we cannot narrow
    down the true value of $q$. Thus truth-tracking is only possible for $p$.
    %
    The second patient still provides useful information, though, since
    together with the reports on $\patientA{}$,
    $\tech{}$'s lack of expertise tells us all the (in)distinctions between
    states they are able to make. Namely, $\tech{}$ cannot distinguish between
    $p \land q$ and $p \land \neg q$. Thus we can find the truth about
    $\tech{}$'s expertise.

\end{example}

\begin{chapteroutline}
    In \cref{sec_preliminaries} we outline the logical framework for reasoning
    about expertise. \cref{sec_truthtracking} introduces the key concepts of
    truth-tracking and solvable questions. We characterise solvable questions in
    \cref{sec_characterising_solvable_questions}, and explore what they can reveal
    about the actual world in \cref{sec_learning_info}. \cref{sec_methods} looks at
    learning methods themselves, and characterises truth-tracking methods. We
    conclude in \cref{sec_conclusion}.
\end{chapteroutline}

\section{Preliminaries}
\label{sec_preliminaries}

In this section we recall the logical framework of
\textcite{singleton_booth_22_preprint} for reasoning with non-expert sources.

\paragraph{Syntax.}

Let $\propvars$ be a finite set of propositional variables, and let $\Lprop$
denote the propositional language generated from $\propvars$. We use $\Lprop$
to model the domain underlying the truth-tracking problem; it describes the
``ontic" facts of the world, irrespective of the expertise of the sources.
Formulas in $\Lprop$ will be denoted by lower-case Greek letters ($\phi$,
$\psi$, etc).

Let $\srcs$ be a finite set of sources. The language $\L$ extends $\Lprop$ with
expertise and soundness formulas for each source $i \in \srcs$, and is defined
by the following grammar:
\[
    \Phi
    ::=  \phi
    \mid \E_i\phi
    \mid \S_i\phi
    \mid \Phi \land \Phi
    \mid \neg\Phi,
\]
for $\phi \in \Lprop$ and $i \in \srcs$. Formulas in $\L$ will be denoted by
upper-case Greek letters ($\Phi$, $\Psi$ etc). Other logical connectives
($\lor$, $\limplies$, $\liff$) are introduced as abbreviations. We read
$\E_i\phi$ as ``$i$ has expertise on $\phi$", and $\S_i\phi$ as ``$\phi$ is
sound for $i$". Note that we restrict the expertise and soundness formulas to
propositional arguments, and do not considered iterated formulas such as
$\E_i\S_j\phi$.

\paragraph{Semantics.}

Let $\vals$ denote the set of propositional valuations
over $\propvars$. We represent the expertise of a source $i$ with a
\emph{partition} $\Pi_i$ of $\vals$. Intuitively, this partition represents
the distinctions between states the source is able to make: valuations in the
same cell in $\Pi_i$ are indistinguishable to $i$, whereas $i$ is able to tell
apart valuations in different cells. We say $i$ has expertise on $\phi$ iff $i$
can distinguish all $\phi$ states from $\neg\phi$ states, and $\phi$ is sound
for $i$ if the ``actual" state is indistinguishable from some $\phi$ state.
Note that these notions are closely linked to \emph{S5 knowledge} from
epistemic logic; see
\cite{singleton_booth_22_preprint,singleton2021logic} for further discussion.

Let $\css$ be a finite set of \emph{cases}, thought of as independent
instantiations of the domain of interest. For example, the cases in
\cref{ex_informal_example} are the patients $\patientA{}$ and $\patientB{}$. We
consider the expertise of sources to be fixed across all cases.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \input{chapters/truth-tracking/tikz/world_example.tex}
    \caption{
        Example of a world $W$, which formalises \cref{ex_informal_example}.
        Here $\propvars = \{p, q\}$, $\srcs = \{\dr{}, \tech{}\}$ and $\css =
        \{\patientA{}, \patientB{}\}$.
    }
    \label{fig_example_world}
\end{figure}

A \emph{world} is a pair $W = \tuple{\{v_c\}_{c \in \css},
\{\Pi_i\}_{i \in \srcs}}$, where
\begin{itemize}
    \item $v_c \in \vals$ is the ``actual" valuation for case $c$;
    \item $\Pi_i \subseteq 2^\vals$ is a partition representing the
          expertise of $i$.
\end{itemize}

Let $\worlds$ denote the set of worlds. Note that $\worlds$ is finite, since
$\vals$, $\css$ and $\srcs$ are.
%
For $\phi \in \Lprop$, write $\propmods{\phi} \subseteq \vals$ for the
models of $\phi$, and write $v \propmodels \phi$ iff $v \in \propmods{\phi}$.
The consequences of a set $\Gamma \subseteq \Lprop$ is denoted by
$\cnprop{\phi}$, and we write $\Gamma \propmodels \phi$ if $\phi \in
\cnprop{\Gamma}$.
%
For a partition $\Pi$, let $\Pi[v]$ denote the unique cell in $\Pi$ containing
$v$, and write $\Pi[U] = \bigcup_{v \in U}{\Pi[v]}$ for $U \subseteq
\vals$. For brevity, we write $\Pi[\phi]$ instead of
$\Pi[\propmods{\phi}]$. We evaluate $\L$ formulas with respect to a world $W$
and a case $c$ as follows:
\begin{align*}
    W, c \models \phi &\iff v_c \propmodels \phi \\
    W, c \models \E_i\phi &\iff \Pi_i[\phi] = \propmods{\phi} \\
    W, c \models \S_i\phi &\iff v_c \in \Pi_i[\phi],
\end{align*}
where the clauses for conjunction and negation are as standard. The semantics
follows the intuition outlined above: $\E_i\phi$ holds when $\Pi_i$ separates
the $\phi$ states from the $\neg\phi$ states, and $\S_i\phi$ holds when $v_c$
is indistinguishable from some $\phi$ state. Consequently, $\S_i\phi$ means
$\phi$ is true \emph{up to the expertise of $i$}: if we weaken $\phi$ according
to $i$'s expertise, the resulting formula (with models $\Pi_i[\phi]$) is true.

\begin{example}
    \label{ex_semantics}
    Take $W$ from \cref{fig_example_world}, which formalises
    \cref{ex_informal_example}. Then $W, c \models \E_{\dr{}}(p \lor q)$ for
    all $c \in \css$, since $\propmods{p \lor q}$ is a cell in $\Pi_{\dr{}}$.
    We also have $W, \patientA{} \models \neg{p} \land \S_{\dr{}}p$, i.e.
    patient $\patientA{}$ does not suffer from condition $p$, but it is
    consistent with $\dr{}$'s expertise that they do.
\end{example}

We write $W, c \models \Gamma$, for a set of formulas $\Gamma \subseteq \L$, if
$W, c \models \Phi$ for all $\Phi \in \Gamma$. For a set $S \subseteq \worlds$,
we write $S, c \models \Phi$ iff $W, c \models \Phi$ for all $W \in S$.

\paragraph{Reports.}

A \emph{report} is triple $\tuple{i, c, \phi}$, where $i \in \srcs$, $c \in
\css$ and $\phi \in \Lprop$ with $\phi \not\equiv \falsum$. In this chapter, we
interpret such triples as source $i$ reporting that $\phi$ is possible in case
$c$. An \emph{input sequence} $\sigma$ is a finite sequence of reports.

A \emph{method} $L$ maps each input sequence $\sigma$ to a set of worlds
$L(\sigma) \subseteq \worlds$, representing the worlds $L$ considers most
plausible given $\sigma$.\footnotemark{} We say $L$ \emph{believes} $S
\subseteq \worlds$ on the basis of $\sigma$ if $L(\sigma) \subseteq S$. $L$ is
\emph{consistent} if $L(\sigma) \ne \emptyset$ for all input sequences
$\sigma$.

\footnotetext{
    We depart from the original framework here by taking a semantic view of
    belief change operators, with the output a set of worlds instead of
    formulas.
}

\section{Truth-Tracking}
\label{sec_truthtracking}

We adapt the framework for truth-tracking
from~\cite{Baltag_2016,baltag_tt_2019}, which finds its roots in
formal learning theory. In this framework, a learning method receives
increasing initial segments of an infinite sequence -- called a \emph{stream}
-- which enumerates all (and only) the true propositions observable at the
``actual" world. Truth-tracking requires the method to eventually find
the actual world (or some property thereof), given \emph{any} stream.

As mentioned in the introduction, in our setting we cannot assume the sources
themselves report only true propositions. Instead, our streams will enumerate
all the \emph{sound} reports. Thus, a stream may include false reports, but
such false reports only arise due to lack of expertise of the corresponding
source.\footnotemark{} Moreover, \emph{all} sound reports will eventually
arise. Since $\S_i\phi$ means $\phi$ is possible from the point of view of
$i$'s expertise, we can view a stream as each source sharing \emph{all that
they consider possible} for each case $c \in \css$. In particular, a non-expert
source may report both $\phi$ and $\neg\phi$ for the same case.

\footnotetext{
    Alternatively, we can consider statements of the form ``$\phi$ is sound for
    $i$ in case $c$" as a higher-order ``proposition"; a stream then enumerates
    all true propositions of this kind.
}

\begin{definition}
    \label{def_stream}
    An infinite sequence of reports $\rho$ is a \emph{stream} for $W$ iff for
    all $i, c, \phi$:
    \[
        \tuple{i, c, \phi} \in \rho \iff W, c \models \S_i\phi.
    \]
\end{definition}

We refer to the left-to-right implication as \emph{soundness} of $\rho$ for
$W$, and the right-to-left direction as \emph{completeness}. Note that every
world $W$ has some stream: the set $\{\tuple{i, c, \phi} \mid W, c \models
\S_i\phi\}$ is countable, so can be indexed by $\N$ to form a stream. For $n
\in \N$ we let $\rho_n$ denote the $n$-th report in $\rho$, and write $\rho[n]$
for the finite initial segment of $\rho$ of length $n$.

\begin{example}
    \label{ex_stream}
    Consider $W$ from \cref{fig_example_world} and case $\patientA{}$. From the
    point of view of $\dr{}$'s expertise, the ``actual" world could be $pq$,
    $\bar{p}q$, $p\bar{q}$. Consequently, in a stream for $W$, $\dr{}$ will
    report $p$, $\neg p$, $q$, $\neg q$, $p \lor q$, and so on. A report that
    $\dr{}$ will \emph{not} give is $\neg (p \lor q)$, since $\dr{}$ has
    expertise to know this is false.

    Note that $v_{\patientA{}}$ and $v_{\patientB{}}$ are indistinguishable to
    $\dr{}$, so the reports of $\dr{}$ in any stream will be the same for both
    cases. In contrast, $\tech{}$ \emph{can} distinguish the two cases, and
    will report $\neg p$ in case $\patientA{}$ but not in $\patientB{}$, and
    $p$ in case $\patientB{}$ but not in $\patientA{}$.
\end{example}

A \emph{question} $Q$ is a partition of $\worlds$. That is, a question is a set
of disjoint \emph{answers} $A \in Q$, with each world $W$ appearing in a unique
cell $Q[W]$ -- the correct answer at $W$.

\begin{example}\leavevmode
    \label{ex_questions}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Any formula $\Phi \in \L$ and case $c$ defines a question
              $Q_{\Phi, c}$, whose two cells consist of the worlds satisfying
              $\Phi$, respectively $\neg\Phi$, in case $c$. Intuitively, this
              question asks whether $\Phi$ is true or false in case $c$.
        \item The finest question $Q_\bot = \{\{W\} \mid W \in \worlds\}$ asks:
              what is the ``actual" world?
        \item More generally, for any set $X$ and function $f: \worlds \to X$,
              the equivalence relation given by $W \simeq_f W'$ iff $f(W) =
              f(W')$ defines a question $Q_f$.

              In this way any data associated with a world gives rise to a
              question. For example, if $f(W) = \{i \in \srcs \mid \Pi^W_i[p]
              = \propmods{p}\}$ we ask for the set of sources with expertise
              on $p$; if $f(W) = |\{c \in \css \mid W, c \models p\}|$ we
              ask for the number of cases where $p$ holds, etc.

              In fact, all questions are of this form: given $Q$ we may define $f:
              \worlds \to Q$ by $f(W) = Q[W]$; then $Q_f = Q$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{example}

A method solves $Q$ if it eventually believes the correct answer when given any
stream.

\begin{definition}
    \label{def_solvability}
    A method $L$ \emph{solves} a question $Q$ if for all worlds $W$ and all
    streams $\rho$ for $W$, there is $n \in \N$ such that $L(\rho[m]) \subseteq
    Q[W]$ for all $m \ge n$. A question $Q$ is \emph{solvable} if there is some
    consistent method $L$ which solves $Q$.
\end{definition}

Note that we do not require $W \in L(\rho[m])$.
%
Since we work in a finite framework, solvability can be also expressed
in terms of eliminating incorrect worlds.

\begin{proposition}
    \label{prop_elimination_solving}
    A method $L$ solves $Q$ if and only if for all $W$, all streams $\rho$ for
    $W$, and all $W' \notin Q[W]$, there is $n_{W'} \in \N$ such that $W'
    \notin L(\rho[m])$ for all $m \ge n_{W'}$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
    ``if": Taking $n = \max\{n_{W'} \mid W' \notin Q[W]\}$, which exists
    since $\worlds$ is finite, $L(\rho[m]) \subseteq Q[W]$ for $m \ge
    n$.

    ``only if": Taking $n$ from the definition of $L$ solving $Q$, we may
    simply take $n_{W'} = n$ for all $W' \notin Q[W]$.
\end{proof}

\section{Characterising Solvable Questions}
\label{sec_characterising_solvable_questions}

In this section we explore solvability of questions, finding that there is a
unique ``hardest" question which subsumes all solvable questions. We show this
is itself solvable, and thus obtain a precise characterisation of solvability.

Questions are partially ordered by partition refinement: $Q \refines Q'$ iff
each $A' \in Q'$ can be written as a union of answers from $Q$. Equivalently,
$Q[W] \subseteq Q'[W]$ for all $W$. This can be interpreted as a
\emph{difficulty ordering}: if $Q \refines Q'$ then each answer of $Q'$ is just
a disjunction of answers of $Q$, and thus $Q'$ is \emph{easier} than $Q$.
Naturally, if $Q$ is solvable then so too is any easier question.

\begin{proposition}
    \label{prop_easier_questions_also_solvable}
    If $Q$ is solvable and $Q \refines Q'$, then $Q'$ is solvable.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    The method which solves $Q$ also solves $Q'$.
\end{proof}

Since question solving is based on streams of sound reports, worlds satisfying
the same soundness statements cannot be distinguished by any solvable question.
To formalise this, define a preorder $\specleq$ on $\worlds$ by
\[
    W \specleq W'
    \iff
    \forall i, c, \phi:\
        W, c \models \S_i\phi \implies W', c \models \S_i\phi.
\]
Thus, $W \specleq W'$ iff any report sound for $W$ is also sound for $W'$. We
denote by $\speclt$ and $\speceq$ the strict and symmetric parts of $\specleq$,
respectively.\footnotemark{}

\footnotetext{
    \textcite{Baltag_2016} explore \emph{topological} interpretations of
    solvability by considering the topology on the set of worlds generated by
    observable propositions. In our setting, this is the topology generated by
    sets of the form $\{W \mid W, c \models \S_i\phi\}$. In this topology,
    $\specleq$ is the \emph{specialisation preorder}.
}

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lemma_spec_active_cell}
    $W \specleq W'$ if and only if for all $i \in \srcs$ and $c \in \css$,
    $\Pi^W_i[v^W_c] \subseteq \Pi^{W'}_i[v^{W'}_c]$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    ``if": Suppose $W, c \models \S_i\phi$. Then $v^W_c \in \Pi^W_i[\phi]$, so
    there is $u \in \propmods{\phi}$ such that $v^W_c \in \Pi^W_i[u]$.
    Consequently $u \in \Pi^W_i[v^W_c] \subseteq \Pi^{W'}_i[v^{W'}_c]$, which
    means $v^{W'}_c \in \Pi^{W'}_i[u] \subseteq \Pi^{W'}_i[\phi]$. Hence $W', c
    \models \S_i\phi$. This shows $W \specleq W'$.

    ``only if": Let $u \in \Pi^W_i[v^W_c]$. Let $\phi$ be any formula with
    $\propmods{\phi} = \{u\}$. Then $W, c \models \S_i\phi$, so $W \specleq W'$
    gives $W', c \models \S_i\phi$, i.e. $v^{W'}_c \in \Pi^{W'}_i[u]$, so $u
    \in \Pi^{W'}_i[v^{W'}_c]$. Hence $\Pi^W_i[v^W_c] \subseteq
    \Pi^{W'}_i[v^{W'}_c]$.
\end{proof}

Note that $\Pi_i[v_c]$ is the set of valuations indistinguishable from the
``actual" valuation in case $c$, for source $i$. In light of
\cref{lemma_spec_active_cell}, we can interpret $W \specleq W'$ as saying that
all sources are \emph{more knowledgeable} in each case $c$ in world $W$ than in
$W'$. However, $W \specleq W'$ does not say anything about the partition cells
not containing some $v_c$.

\begin{proposition}
    \label{prop_speceq_equivalent_conditions}
    The following are equivalent.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item\label{item_same_streams} $W$ and $W'$ have exactly the same
            streams.
        \item\label{item_speceq} $W \speceq W'$.
        \item\label{item_active_cells_equal} For all $i \in \srcs$ and $c \in
            \css$, $\Pi^W_i[v^W_c] = \Pi^{W'}_i[v^{W'}_c]$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
    \cref{item_speceq} and \cref{item_active_cells_equal} are easily seen to be
    equivalent in light of \cref{lemma_spec_active_cell}. To show
    \cref{item_same_streams} is equivalent to \cref{item_speceq}, first suppose
    $W$ and $W'$ have the same streams, and suppose $W, c \models \S_i\phi$.
    Taking an arbitrary stream $\rho$ for $W$, completeness gives $\tuple{i, c,
    \phi} \in \rho$. But $\rho$ is a stream for $W'$ too, and soundness gives
    $W', c \models \S_i\phi$. Hence $W \specleq W'$. A symmetrical argument
    shows $W' \specleq W$.

    On the other hand, if $W \speceq W'$ then $W$ and $W'$ satisfy exactly the
    same soundness statements, so it is clear that any sequence $\rho$ is a
    stream for $W$ iff it is a stream for $W'$.
\end{proof}

Since it will play a special role throughout, we denote by $Q^*$ the question
formed by the equivalence relation $\speceq$. Then $Q^*[W]$ is the set of $W'$
with $W \speceq W'$. Since no solvable question can distinguish
$\speceq$-equivalent worlds, we have the following.

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lemma_solvable_implies_coarser_than_qstar}
    If $Q$ is solvable then $Q^* \refines Q$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    Suppose $L$ is a consistent method solving $Q$. We show $Q^*[W] \subseteq
    Q[W]$ for all $W$.  Indeed, let $W' \in Q^*[W]$. Then $W' \speceq W$.
    Taking any stream $\rho$ for $W$, there is $n$ such that $L(\rho[m])
    \subseteq Q[W]$ for $m \ge n$. On the other hand $\rho$ is also a stream
    for $W'$ by \cref{prop_speceq_equivalent_conditions}, so there is $n'$ such
    that $L(\rho[m]) \subseteq Q[W']$ for $m \ge n'$. Setting $m = \max\{n,
    n'\}$ and using the fact that $L$ is consistent, we find $\emptyset \subset
    L(\rho[m]) \subseteq Q[W] \cap Q[W']$. Since $Q$ is a partition, this means
    $Q[W] = Q[W']$, i.e. $W' \in Q[W]$.
\end{proof}

So, any solvable question is coarser than $Q^*$. Fortunately, $Q^*$ itself is
solvable since we work in a finite framework. For a sequence $\sigma$, write
$\Xsnd_\sigma$ for the set of worlds $W$ such that $W, c \models \S_i\phi$ for
all $\tuple{i, c, \phi} \in \sigma$. To solve $Q^*$ it suffices to conjecture
the $\specleq$-minimal worlds in $\Xsnd_\sigma$.

\begin{proposition}
    \label{prop_qstar_solvable}
    $Q^*$ is solvable.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
    Set $L(\sigma) = \min_{\specleq}{\Xsnd_\sigma}$ if $\Xsnd_\sigma \ne
    \emptyset$, and $L(\sigma) = \worlds$ otherwise (where $W \in
    \min_{\specleq}{\Xsnd_\sigma}$ iff $W \in \Xsnd_\sigma$ and there is no
    $W' \in \Xsnd_\sigma$ with $W' \speclt W$). Note that $L$ is consistent
    since $\worlds$ is finite and non-empty. We show that $L$ solves $Q^*$ by
    \cref{prop_elimination_solving}. Take any world $W$ and a stream $\rho$.
    First note that, by soundness of $\rho$, $W \in \Xsnd_{\rho[n]}$ for all $n
    \in \N$, so we are always in the first case in the definition of $L$.

    Take $W' \notin Q^*[W]$. Then $W \not\speceq W'$. Consider two cases:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Case 1:} $W \not\specleq W'$. By definition, there are
              $i, c, \phi$ such that $W, c \models \S_i\phi$ but $W', c
              \not\models \S_i\phi$. By completeness of $\rho$ for $W$, there
              is $n$ such that $\rho_n = \tuple{i, c, \phi}$. Consequently $W'
              \notin \Xsnd_{\rho[m]}$ for all $m \ge n$. Since $L(\rho[m])
              \subseteq \Xsnd_{\rho[m]}$, we have $W' \notin L(\rho[m])$ as
              required.

        \item \textbf{Case 2:} $W \speclt W'$. Since $W \in \Xsnd_{\rho[n]}$
              for all $n$, $W'$ can never be $\specleq$-minimal. Thus $W'
              \notin L(\rho[n])$ for all $n$.
    \end{itemize}
    Note that these cases are exhaustive since $W \not\speceq W'$. This
    completes the proof.
\end{proof}

Putting
\cref{prop_easier_questions_also_solvable,lemma_solvable_implies_coarser_than_qstar,prop_qstar_solvable}
together we obtain a characterisation of solvable questions.

\begin{theorem}
    \label{thm_solvability_characterisation}
    $Q$ is solvable if and only if $Q^* \refines Q$.
\end{theorem}

Given this result, $Q^*$ is the only question that really matters: any other
question is either unsolvable or formed by coarsening $Q^*$. With this in mind,
we make the following definition.

\begin{definition}
    \label{def_truthtracking}
    A method is \emph{truth-tracking} if it solves $Q^*$.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
    \label{ex_questions_revisited}
    We refer back to the questions of \cref{ex_questions}.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The question $Q_{\phi, c}$, for any propositional formula $\phi
              \in \Lprop$, is solvable if and only if either $\phi$ is a
              tautology or a contradiction. To see the ``only if" part,
              consider the contrapositive. For any contingent formula $\phi$,
              take worlds $W_1, W_2$ where no source has any expertise (i.e.
              $\Pi^{W_k}_i = \{\vals\}$) but where $v^{W_1}_c \propmodels
              \phi$, $v^{W_2}_c \propmodels \neg\phi$. Then $W_1 \speceq W_2$
              (e.g. by \cref{prop_speceq_equivalent_conditions}) but $W_1
              \notin Q_{\phi, c}[W_2]$.

              Similarly, $Q_{\E_i\phi, c}$ is solvable iff either $\phi$ is a
              tautology or contradiction, when $|\propvars| \ge 2$.

        \item The finest question $Q_\bot$ is not solvable, since there are
              always distinct $W, W'$ with $W \speceq W'$.

        \item In general, $Q_f$ is solvable iff $W \speceq W'$ implies $f(W) =
            f(W')$, i.e. iff $f$ takes a unique value on each equivalence class
            of $\speceq$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{example}

\section{What Information can be Learned?}
\label{sec_learning_info}

Solving a question $Q$ has a \emph{global} character: we must find the correct
answer $Q[W]$ starting from \emph{any} world $W$. As we saw in
\cref{ex_questions_revisited}, this rules out the possibility of solving many
interesting questions due to the presence of ``abnormal" worlds (e.g. those in
which no sources have any expertise). In this section we take a more
fine-grained approach by looking \emph{locally}: given some \emph{particular}
world $W$, what can we learn about $W$ via truth-tracking methods?
Concretely, what properties of $W$ are uniquely defined across $Q^*[W]$?

Clearly this depends on $W$. If no sources have expertise then
source partitions are uniquely defined (since \emph{all} consistent formulas
are sound, and only the trivial partitions have this property), but any
combination of valuations is possible. On the other hand if all sources have
total expertise then valuations are uniquely defined, but there may not be
enough cases to uniquely identify the source partitions. Of particular interest
is the case where $Q^*[W]$ contains only $W$; starting in such a world,
truth-tracking methods are able to find the true world exactly.

In what follows, say $S$ \emph{decides $\Phi$ in case
$c$} iff either $S, c \models \Phi$ or $S, c \models \neg\Phi$. That is, the
truth value of $\Phi$ in case $c$ is unambiguously defined across $S$. If
$\Phi$ does not depend on the case (e.g. if $\Phi = \E_i\phi$) we simply say
$S$ decides $\Phi$.

\subsection{Valuations}

We start by considering when $Q^*[W]$ decides a propositional formula $\phi$ in
case $c$, i.e. when truth-tracking methods are guaranteed to successfully
determine whether or not $\phi$ holds in the ``actual" world. This leads to a
precise characterisation of when $Q^*[W]$ contains a \emph{unique} valuation in
case $c$, so that $v^W_c$ can be found exactly.

We need a notion of \emph{group expertise}. For $\srcs' \subseteq \srcs$ and
$\Gamma \subseteq \Lprop$, write $W \models \E_{\srcs'}{\Gamma}$ if for each
$\psi \in \Gamma$ there is $i \in \srcs'$ such that $W \models \E_i\psi$. Then
the group $\srcs'$ have expertise on $\Gamma$ in a collective sense, even if no
single source has expertise on \emph{all} formulas in $\Gamma$.
%
We have that $\phi$ is decided if $\srcs$ have group expertise on a set of true
formulas $\Gamma \subseteq \Lprop$ such that either $\Gamma \propmodels \phi$
or $\Gamma \propmodels \neg\phi$.

\begin{theorem}
    \label{thm_decide_phi}
    $Q^*[W]$ decides $\phi \in \Lprop$ in case $c$ if and only if there is
    $\Gamma \subseteq \Lprop$ such that
    \begin{inlinelist}
        \item $W, c \models \Gamma$;
        \item $W \models \E_{\srcs}{\Gamma}$; and
        \item either $\Gamma \propmodels \phi$ or $\Gamma \propmodels
              \neg\phi$.
    \end{inlinelist}
\end{theorem}

$Q^*[W]$ decides \emph{all} propositional formulas -- and thus determines the
$c$-valuation $v^W_c$ exactly -- iff $\srcs$ have group expertise on a
maximally consistent set of true formulas. For $S \subseteq \worlds$ and $c \in
\css$, write $\vals^S_c = \{v^W_c \mid W \in S\}$ for the $c$-valuations
appearing in $S$.

\begin{theorem}
    \label{thm_qstar_unique_cval_conditions}
    The following are equivalent.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item\label{item_uniqueval} $\vals^{Q^*[W]}_c = \{v^W_c\}$.
        \item\label{item_define_all_phi} $Q^*[W]$ decides $\phi$ in case $c$,
            for all $\phi \in \Lprop$.
        \item\label{item_mcs_gamma} There is $\Gamma \subseteq \Lprop$ such
            that
              \begin{inlinelist}
                  \item $W, c \models \Gamma$;
                  \item $W \models \E_{\srcs}{\Gamma}$; and
                  \item $\cnprop{\Gamma}$ is a maximally consistent set.
              \end{inlinelist}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

We illustrate \cref{thm_qstar_unique_cval_conditions} with an example.

\begin{example}
    \label{ex_qstar_unique_cval_conditions}
    Consider $W$ from \cref{fig_example_world}.
    %
    Then one can show $\vals^{Q^*[W]}_{\patientA{}} = \{\bar{p}q\} =
    \{v^W_{\patientA{}}\}$, and $\vals^{Q^*[W]}_{\patientB{}} = \{pq,
    p\bar{q}\} \ne \{v^W_{\patientB{}}\}$. That is, $W$'s $\patientA{}$
    valuation is uniquely determined by truth-tracking methods, but its
    $\patientB{}$ valuation is not: there is some world $W' \speceq W$ whose
    $\patientB{}$-valuation differs from $W$'s. This matches the informal
    reasoning in \cref{ex_informal_example}, in which patient $\patientA{}$
    could be successfully diagnosed on both $p$ and $q$ but $\patientB{}$ could
    not.

    Formally, take $\Gamma = \{p \lor q, \neg p\}$. Then $W, \patientA{}
    \models \Gamma$, $W \models \E_{\srcs}{\Gamma}$ (since $\dr{}$ has
    expertise on $p \lor q$ and $\tech{}$ has expertise on $\neg p$), and
    $\cnprop{\Gamma} = \cnprop{\neg p \land q}$, which is maximally consistent.
    %
    This example shows how the expertise of multiple sources can be combined to
    find valuations uniquely, but that this is not necessarily possible in all
    cases.

\end{example}

The remainder of this section proves
\cref{thm_decide_phi,thm_qstar_unique_cval_conditions}.

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lemma_phi_and_ephi}
    For $W \speceq W'$, $i \in \srcs$ and $\phi \in \Lprop$,
    \[
        W, c \models \phi \land \E_i\phi \implies W', c \models \phi.
    \]
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    From $W, c \models \phi$ we have $v^W_c \in \propmods{\phi}$, so
    $\Pi^W_i[v^W_c] \subseteq \Pi^W_i[\phi]$. But $W, c \models \E_i\phi$ means
    $\Pi^W_i[\phi] = \propmods{\phi}$, so in fact $\Pi^W_i[v^W_c] \subseteq
    \propmods{\phi}$. Now using $W \speceq W'$, we find $v^{W'}_c \in
    \Pi^{W'}_i[v^{W'}_c] = \Pi^W_i[v^W_c] \subseteq \propmods{\phi}$. Hence
    $W', c \models \phi$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lemma_vals_qstar_c}
    $\vals^{Q^*[W]}_c = \bigcap_{i \in \srcs}{\Pi^W_i[v^W_c]}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    ``$\subseteq$": Suppose $u \in \vals^{Q^*[W]}_c$. Then there is $W' \speceq
    W$ such that $u = v^{W'}_c$. Let $i \in \srcs$. Then $u \in
    \Pi^{W'}_i[v^{W'}_c] = \Pi^W_i[v^W_c]$ by
    \cref{prop_speceq_equivalent_conditions}, as required.

    ``$\supseteq$": Suppose $u \in \bigcap_{i \in \srcs}{\Pi^W_i[v^W_c]}$. Let
    $W'$ be the world obtained from $W$ by setting the $c$-valuation to $u$,
    keeping partitions and other valuations the same. We need to show $W'
    \speceq W$. We do so via \cref{prop_speceq_equivalent_conditions}, by
    showing condition \cref{item_active_cells_equal}. Take any $i \in
    \srcs$ and $d \in \css$. If $d \ne c$ then $v^{W'}_d = v^W_d$; since
    partitions are the same in $W'$ as in $W$ we get $\Pi^W_i[v^W_d] =
    \Pi^{W'}_i[v^{W'}_d]$. For $c = d$, note $\Pi^{W'}_i[v^{W'}_c] =
    \Pi^W_i[u]$. By assumption $u \in \Pi^W_i[v^W_c]$, so $\Pi^W_i[u] =
    \Pi^W_i[v^W_c]$. Hence $\Pi^{W'}_i[v^{W'}_c] = \Pi^W_i[v^W_c]$ as required.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of \cref{thm_decide_phi}]
    ``if": Take $W' \in Q^*[W]$. Note that since $W, c \models \Gamma$ and $W,
    c \models \E_\srcs\Gamma$, we may apply \cref{lemma_phi_and_ephi} to each
    formula in $\Gamma$ in turn to find $W', c \models \Gamma$. Now, if $W, c
    \models \phi$ then we must have $\Gamma \propmodels \phi$, so $W', c
    \models \phi$ too. Otherwise $W, c \not\models \phi$, so we must have
    $\Gamma \propmodels \neg\phi$ and $W', c \not\models \phi$. This shows $W',
    c \models \phi$ if and only if $W, c \models \phi$. Since $W' \in Q^*[W]$
    was arbitrary, $Q^*[W]$ decides $\phi$ in case $c$.

    ``only if": Suppose $Q^*[W]$ decides $\phi$ in case $c$. For each $i \in
    \srcs$, take some $\psi_i \in \Lprop$ such that $\propmods{\psi_i} =
    \Pi^W_i[v^W_c]$. Then $W \models \E_i\psi_i$. Set $\Gamma = \{\psi_i\}_{i
    \in \srcs}$. Clearly $W, c \models \Gamma$ and $W \models \E_\srcs\Gamma$.
    Now, take any $u \in \propmods{\Gamma}$. By \cref{lemma_vals_qstar_c},
    $\propmods{\Gamma} = \bigcap_{i \in \srcs}{\Pi^W_i[v^W_c]} =
    \vals^{Q^*[W]}_c$. Hence there is some $W' \in Q^*[W]$ such that $u =
    v^{W'}_c$. But $Q^*[W]$ decides $\phi$ in case $c$, so $W', c \models \phi$
    iff $W, c \models \phi$. Thus $u \propmodels \phi$ iff $W, c \models \phi$.
    Since $u \in \propmods{\Gamma}$ was arbitrary, we have $\Gamma \propmodels
    \phi$ if $W, c \models \phi$, and $\Gamma \propmodels \neg\phi$ otherwise.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of \cref{thm_qstar_unique_cval_conditions}]
    \cref{item_uniqueval} implies \cref{item_define_all_phi}: If $W' \in
    Q^*[W]$ then $W$ and $W'$ share the same $c$-valuation by
    \cref{item_uniqueval}, so clearly $W, c \models \phi$ iff $W', c \models
    \phi$, for any $\phi$. Hene $Q^*[W]$ decides $\phi$ in case $c$.

    \cref{item_define_all_phi} implies \cref{item_uniqueval}: Clearly $v^W_c
    \in \vals^{Q^*[W]}_c$. Suppose $u \in \vals^{Q^*[W]}_c$. Then there is $W'
    \in Q^*[W]$ such that $u = v^{W'}_c$. Let $p \in \propvars$. Since $W, W'
    \in Q^*[W]$ and $Q^*[W]$ decides $p$ in case $c$, we have $u \propmodels p$
    iff $v^W_c \propmodels p$. Since $p$ was arbitrary, $u = v^W_c$.

    \cref{item_define_all_phi} implies \cref{item_mcs_gamma}: Applying
    \cref{thm_decide_phi} to each $\phi \in \Lprop$, there is a set
    $\Gamma_\phi \subseteq \Lprop$ such that $W, c \models \Gamma_\phi$, $W
    \models \E_\srcs\Gamma_\phi$, and either $\Gamma_\phi \propmodels \phi$ or
    $\Gamma_\phi \propmodels \neg\phi$. Set $\Gamma = \bigcup_{\phi \in
    \Lprop}{\Gamma_\phi}$. Clearly $W, c \models \Gamma$ -- so $\Gamma$ is
    consistent -- and $W \models \E_\srcs\Gamma$. To show $\cnprop{\Gamma}$ is
    \emph{maximally} consistent, suppose $\phi \notin \cnprop{\Gamma}$. From
    monotonicity of classical consequence and $\Gamma_\phi \subseteq \Gamma$,
    we get $\phi \notin \cnprop{\Gamma_\phi}$. Hence $\Gamma_\phi \propmodels
    \neg\phi$, and $\Gamma \propmodels \neg\phi$ too. This means
    $\cnprop{\Gamma} \cup \{\phi\}$ is inconsistent, and we are done.

    \cref{item_mcs_gamma} implies \cref{item_define_all_phi}: Take $\phi \in
    \Lprop$. Then we may apply \cref{thm_decide_phi} with $\Gamma$ from
    \cref{item_mcs_gamma} -- noting that the maximal consistency property
    ensure either $\Gamma \propmodels \phi$ or $\Gamma \models \neg\phi$ -- to
    see that $Q^*[W]$ decides $\phi$ in case $c$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Source Partitions}

We now apply the analysis of the previous section to the set of source
partitions $\{\Pi^W_i\}_{i \in \srcs}$. For $S \subseteq \worlds$ and $i \in
\srcs$, write $\parts^S_i = \{\Pi^W_i \mid S \in W\}$ for the $i$-partitions
appearing in $S$. When $S = Q^*[W]$, these are exactly those partitions which
agree with $\Pi^W_i$ at each valuation $v^W_c$.

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lemma_qstar_partitions}
    $\Pi \in \parts^{Q^*[W]}_i$
    if and only if
    $\{\Pi^W_i[v^W_c]\}_{c \in \css} \subseteq \Pi$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}

    ``if": Suppose $\{\Pi^W_i[v^W_c]\}_{c \in \css} \subseteq \Pi$. Let $W'$ be
    obtained from $W$ by setting $i$'s partition to $\Pi$, keeping valuations
    and other source partitions the same. We claim $W' \speceq W$. Indeed, take
    any $j \in \srcs$ and $c \in \css$. If $j \ne i$ then $\Pi^{W'}_j =
    \Pi^W_i$; since valuations are the same we get $\Pi^W_j[v^W_c] =
    \Pi^{W'}_j[v^{W'}_c]$. For $j = i$, note that since $\Pi^W_i[v^W_c] \in
    \Pi$ by assumption, and $v^W_c \in \Pi^W_i[v^W_c]$, we have $\Pi[v^W_c] =
    \Pi^W_i[v^W_c]$. By construction of $W'$, this means $\Pi^W_i[v^W_c] =
    \Pi[v^{W'}_c] = \Pi^{W'}_i[v^{W'}_c]$. By
    \cref{prop_speceq_equivalent_conditions},
    $W' \speceq W$. Hence $\Pi \in \parts^{Q^*[W]}_i$.

    ``only if": This is clear from \cref{prop_speceq_equivalent_conditions}.
\end{proof}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \input{chapters/truth-tracking/tikz/partition_example.tex}
    \caption{
        World $W$ from \cref{ex_qstar_partitions}. Note that for brevity we do
        not label the valuations.
    }
    \label{fig_qstar_partitions}
\end{figure}

\begin{example}
    \label{ex_qstar_partitions}
    Suppose $|\propvars| = 3$, $\css = \{c_1, c_2\}$ and $i \in \srcs$.
    Consider a world $W$ whose $i$-partition is shown in
    \cref{fig_qstar_partitions}. By \cref{lemma_qstar_partitions}, a partition
    $\Pi$ appears as $\Pi^{W'}_i$ for some $W' \speceq W$ if and only if it
    contains the leftmost and bottommost sets. Any such $\Pi$ consists
    of these cells together with a partition of the shaded area. Since there
    are 5 possible partitions of a 3-element set, it follows that
    $|\parts^{Q^*[W]}_i| = 5$.
\end{example}

\cref{ex_qstar_partitions} hints that if the cells containing the valuations
$v^W_c$ cover the whole space of valuations $\vals$, or just omit a single
valuation, then $i$'s partition is uniquely defined in $Q^*[W]$. That is,
truth-tracking methods can determine the full extent of $i$'s expertise if the
``actual" world is $W$. Indeed, we have the following analogue of
\cref{thm_qstar_unique_cval_conditions} for partitions.

\begin{theorem}
    \label{thm_qstar_unique_ipartition_conditions}
    The following are equivalent.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item\label{item_uniquepart} $\parts^{Q^*[W]}_i = \{\Pi^W_i\}$.
        \item\label{item_define_all_ephi} $Q^*[W]$ decides $\E_i\phi$ for all
            $\phi \in \Lprop$.
        \item\label{item_r_almost_covers} $|\vals \setminus R| \le 1$, where $R
            = \bigcup_{c \in \css}{\Pi^W_i[v^W_c]}$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

Note that $R = \bigcup_{c \in \css}{\Pi^W_i[v^W_c]}$ is the set of valuations
indistinguishable from the actual state at some case $c$.
\cref{thm_qstar_unique_ipartition_conditions} \cref{item_r_almost_covers} says
this set needs to essentially cover the whole space $\vals$, omitting at most a
single point. In this sense, it is easier to find $\Pi^W_i$ uniquely when $i$
has \emph{less expertise}, since the cells $\Pi^W_i[v^W_c]$ will be larger. In
the extreme case where $i$ has total expertise, i.e. $\Pi^W_i = \{\{v\} \mid v
\in \vals\}$, we need at least $2^{|\propvars|} - 1$ cases with distinct
valuations in order to find $\Pi^W_i$ exactly.

\begin{example}
    \label{ex_qstar_unique_ipartition_conditions}
    In \cref{ex_qstar_partitions} we have already seen an example of a world
    $W$ for which $\parts^{Q^*[W]}_i$ does not contain a unique partition.
    %
    For a positive example, consider the world $W$ from
    \cref{fig_example_world}. Then $\vals \setminus R_{\dr{}} =
    \{\bar{p}\bar{q}\}$ and $\vals \setminus R_{\tech{}} = \emptyset$, so both
    the partitions of $\dr{}$ and $\tech{}$ can be found uniquely by
    truth-tracking methods.
\end{example}

The remainder of this section proves
\cref{thm_qstar_unique_ipartition_conditions}.

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lemma_u_expansion_equal}
    Let $i \in \srcs$ and $U \subseteq \vals$. Then $U \subseteq \bigcup_{c \in
    \css}{\Pi^W_i[v^W_c]}$ and $W \speceq W'$ implies $\Pi^W_i[U] =
    \Pi^{W'}_i[U]$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    It suffices to show that for all $u \in U$ we have $\Pi^W_i[u] =
    \Pi^{W'}_i[u]$, since by definition $\Pi[U] = \bigcup_{u \in U}{\Pi[u]}$.
    Let $u \in U$. Then there is $c \in \css$ such that $u \in \Pi^W_i[v^W_c]$.
    Hence $\Pi^W_i[u] = \Pi^W_i[v^W_c]$. But since $W \speceq W'$,
    $\Pi^W_i[v^W_c] = \Pi^{W'}_i[v^{W'}_c]$. This means $u \in
    \Pi^{W'}_i[v^{W'}_c]$, so $\Pi^{W'}_i[u] = \Pi^{W'}_i[v^{W'}_c] =
    \Pi^W_i[v^W_c] = \Pi^W_i[u]$, as required,
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lemma_decide_ephi}
    $Q^*[W]$ decides $\E_i\phi$ if and only if, writing $R = \bigcup_{c \in
    \css}{\Pi^W_i[v^W_c]}$, either
    \begin{inlinelist}
        \item\label{item_phi_sub_r} $\propmods{\phi} \subseteq R$;
        \item\label{item_negphi_sub_r} $\propmods{\neg\phi} \subseteq R$; or
        \item\label{item_r_boundary} there is some $c \in \css$ such that
            $\Pi^W_i[v^W_c]$ intersects with both $\propmods{\phi}$ and
            $\propmods{\neg\phi}$.
    \end{inlinelist}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}

    ``if": First suppose \cref{item_phi_sub_r} holds. Take $W' \in Q^*[W]$.
    From $\propmods{\phi} \subseteq R$, $W \speceq W'$ and
    \cref{lemma_u_expansion_equal} we get $\Pi^W_i[\phi] = \Pi^{W'}_i[\phi]$.
    Consequently, $W' \models \E_i\phi$ iff $W \models \E_i\phi$. Since $W'$
    was arbitrary, either all worlds in $Q^*[W]$ satisfy $\E_i\phi$, or all do
    not. Hence $Q^*[W]$ decides $\E_i\phi$.

    If \cref{item_negphi_sub_r} holds, a similar argument shows that $Q^*[W]$
    decides $\E_i\neg\phi$. But it is easily checked that $\E_i\phi \equiv
    \E_i\neg\phi$, so $Q^*[W]$ also decides $\E_i\phi$.

    Finally, suppose \cref{item_r_boundary} holds. Then there is $c \in \css$
    and $u \in \propmods{\phi}$, $v \in \propmods{\neg\phi}$ such that $u, v
    \in \Pi^W_i[v^W_c]$. We claim $Q^*[W] \models \neg\E_i\phi$. Indeed, take
    $W' \in Q^*[W]$. Then $\Pi^W_i[v^W_c] = \Pi^{W'}_i[v^{W'}_c]$, so $u, v \in
    \Pi^{W'}_i[v^{W'}_c]$. In particular, $u$ and $v$ differ on $\phi$ but are
    contained in the same cell in $\Pi^{W'}_i$. Hence $W' \models
    \neg\E_i\phi$.

    ``only if": We show the contrapositive. Suppose none of
    \cref{item_phi_sub_r}, \cref{item_negphi_sub_r}, \cref{item_r_boundary}
    hold. Then there is $u \in \propmods{\phi} \setminus R$ and $v \in
    \propmods{\neg\phi} \setminus R$. Let us define two worlds $W_1$, $W_2$
    from $W$ by modifying $i$'s partition:
    \begin{align*}
        \Pi^{W_1}_i
            &= \{\Pi^W_i[v^W_c]\}_{c \in \css} \cup \{\vals \setminus R \}, \\
        \Pi^{W_2}_i
            &= \{\Pi^W_i[v^W_c]\}_{c \in \css} \cup \{\{w\} \mid w \in \vals
                    \setminus R\}.
    \end{align*}
    Then $W_1, W_2 \in Q^*[W]$ by \cref{lemma_qstar_partitions}. We claim that
    $W_1 \models \neg\E_i\phi$ but $W_2 \models \E_i\phi$, which will show
    $Q^*[W]$ does not decide $\E_i\phi$.

    First, note that since $u, v \notin R$, we have $\Pi^{W_1}_i[u] =
    \Pi^{W_1}_i[v] = \vals \setminus R$. Since $u$ and $v$ differ on $\phi$ but
    share the same partition cell, $W_1 \models \neg\E_i\phi$.

    To show $W_2 \models \E_i\phi$, take $w \in \propmods{\phi}$. If $w \notin
    R$ then $\Pi^{W_2}_i[w] = \{w\} \subseteq \propmods{\phi}$. Otherwise there
    is $c \in \css$ such that $w \in \Pi^W_i[v^W_c]$. Thus $\Pi^W_i[v^W_c]$
    intersects with $\propmods{\phi}$. Since \cref{item_r_boundary} does not
    hold, this in fact implies $\Pi^W_i[v^W_c] \subseteq \propmods{\phi}$, and
    consequently $\Pi^{W_2}_i[w] = \Pi^W_i[v^W_c] \subseteq \propmods{\phi}$.
    Since $w \in \propmods{\phi}$ was arbitrary, we have shown
    $\Pi^{W_2}_i[\phi] = \bigcup_{w \in \propmods{\phi}}{\Pi^{W_2}_i[w]}
    \subseteq \propmods{\phi}$. Since the reverse inclusion always holds, this
    shows $W_2 \models \E_i\phi$, and we are done.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of \cref{thm_qstar_unique_ipartition_conditions}]

    The implication \cref{item_uniquepart} to \cref{item_define_all_ephi} is
    clear since if $W' \in Q^*[W]$ then $\Pi^{W'}_i = \Pi^W_i$ by
    \cref{item_uniquepart}, so $W' \models \E_i\phi$ iff $W \models \E_i\phi$,
    and thus $Q^*[W]$ decides $\E_i\phi$.

    To show \cref{item_define_all_ephi} implies \cref{item_r_almost_covers} we
    show the contrapositive. Suppose $|\vals \setminus R| > 1$. Then there are
    distinct $u, v \in \vals \setminus R$. Let $\phi$ be any propositional
    formula with $\propmods{\phi} = \{u\}$. We show by \cref{lemma_decide_ephi}
    that $Q^*[W]$ does not decide $\E_i\phi$. Indeed, all three conditions
    fail: $\propmods{\phi} \not\subseteq R$ (since $u \notin R$),
    $\propmods{\neg\phi} \not\subseteq R$ (since $v \in \propmods{\neg\phi}
    \setminus R$) and no $\Pi^W_i[v^W_c]$ intersects with $\propmods{\phi}$
    (otherwise $u \in \Pi^W_i[v^W_c] \subseteq R$).

    Finally, for \cref{item_r_almost_covers} implies \cref{item_uniquepart} we
    also show the contrapositive. Suppose there is $\Pi \in \parts^{Q^*[W]}_i
    \setminus \{\Pi^W_i\}$. Write $\mathcal{R} = \{\Pi^W_i[v^W_c]\}_{c \in
    \css}$, so that $\mathcal{R}$ is a partition of $R$. By
    \cref{lemma_qstar_partitions}, $\mathcal{R} \subseteq \Pi$. Note that
    $\mathcal{R} \subseteq \Pi^W_i$ too. Since $\Pi \ne \Pi^W_i$, we in fact
    have $\mathcal{R} \subset \Pi$ and $\mathcal{R} \subset \Pi^W_i$. Hence
    $\Pi \setminus \mathcal{R}$ and $\Pi^W_i \setminus \mathcal{R}$ are
    distinct partitions of $\vals \setminus R$. Since a one-element set has a
    unique partition, $\vals \setminus R$ must contain at least two elements.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Learning the Actual World Exactly}

Putting
\cref{thm_qstar_unique_cval_conditions,thm_qstar_unique_ipartition_conditions},
we obtain a precise characterisation of when $W$ can be found \emph{exactly} by
truth-tracking methods, i.e when $Q^*[W] = \{W\}$.

\begin{corollary}
    \label{cor_qstar_unique_world}
    $Q^*[W] = \{W\}$ if and only if
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item There is a collection $\{\Gamma_c\}_{c \in \css} \subseteq
              \Lprop^\css$ such that for each $c$,
              \begin{inlinelist}
                \item $W, c \models \Gamma_c$;
                \item $W \models \E_{\srcs}{\Gamma_c}$;
                \item $\cnprop{\Gamma_c}$ is maximally consistent; and
              \end{inlinelist}
        \item For each each $i \in \srcs$, $|\vals \setminus \bigcup_{c \in
            \css}{\Pi^W_i[v^W_c]}| \le 1$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{corollary}

\section{Truth-Tracking Methods}
\label{sec_methods}

So far we have focussed on solvable questions, and the extent to which they
reveal information about the actual world. We now turn to the methods which
solve them. We give a general characterisation of truth-tracking methods under
mild assumptions, before discussing the family of \emph{conditioning} methods
from \textcite{singleton_booth_22_preprint}.

\subsection{A General Characterisation}

For sequences $\sigma, \delta$, write $\sigma \equiv \delta$ iff $\delta$ is
obtained from $\sigma$ by replacing each report $\tuple{i, c, \phi}$ with
$\tuple{i, c, \psi}$, for some $\psi \equiv \phi$. For $k \in \N$, let
$\sigma^k$ denote the $k$-fold repetition of $\sigma$.
%
Consider the following properties which may hold of a learning method $L$.

\begin{axiom}[\equivalence{}]
    If $\sigma \equiv \delta$ then $L(\sigma) = L(\delta)$.
\end{axiom}

\begin{axiom}[\repetition{}]
    $L(\sigma^k) = L(\sigma)$.
\end{axiom}

\begin{axiom}[\soundness{}]
    $L(\sigma) \subseteq \Xsnd_\sigma$.
\end{axiom}

\equivalence{} says that $L$ should not care about the syntactic form of the
input. \repetition{} says that beliefs should not change if each
source repeats their reports $k$ times. \soundness{} says that all reports in
$\sigma$ are believed to be sound.

For methods satisfying these properties, we have a precise characterisation of
truth-tracking, i.e. necessary and sufficient conditions for $L$ to solve
$Q^*$. First, some new notation is required. Write $\delta \seqss \sigma$ iff
for each $\tuple{i, c, \phi} \in \delta$ there is $\psi \equiv \phi$ such that
$\tuple{i, c, \psi} \in \sigma$. That is, $\sigma$ contains everything $\delta$
does, up to logical equivalence. Set
\[
    T_\sigma
    = \Xsnd_\sigma
        \setminus
        \bigcup\left\{
            \Xsnd_\delta
            \mid
            \delta \not\seqss \sigma\right
        \}
    \subseteq \worlds.
\]
Then $W \in T_\sigma$ iff $\sigma$ is sound for $W$ and any $\delta$ sound for
$W$ has $\delta \seqss \sigma$. In this sense $\sigma$ contains \emph{all}
soundness statements for $W$ -- up to equivalence -- so can be seen as a finite
version of a stream. Let us call $\sigma$ a \emph{psuedo-stream} for $W$
whenever $W \in T_\sigma$.

\begin{theorem}
    \label{thm_tt_characterisation}
    A method $L$ satisfying \equivalence{}, \repetition{} and \soundness{} is
    truth-tracking if and only if it satisfies the following property.
    \begin{axiom}[\credulity{}]
        $
        % \forall \sigma, i, c, \phi:\
        T_\sigma, c \not\models \S_i\phi
        \implies
        L(\sigma), c \models \neg\S_i\phi.
        $
    \end{axiom}

\end{theorem}

Before the proof, we comment on our interpretation of
\credulity{}. It says that whenever $\neg\S_i\phi$
is consistent with $T_\sigma$ -- those $W$ for which $\sigma$ is a
psuedo-stream -- $L$ should believe $\neg\S_i\phi$. Since the number of
sound statements \emph{decreases} with increasing expertise, this is a
principle of \emph{maximal trust}: we should believe $i$ has the expertise to
rule out $\phi$ in case $c$, whenever this is consistent with $T_\sigma$.  That
is, some amount of \emph{credulity} is required to find the truth. Our
assumption that learning methods receive complete streams ensures that, if a
source in fact lacks this expertise, they will eventually report $\phi$ and
this belief can be be retracted.
%
A stronger version of \credulity{} spells this out
explicitly in terms of expertise:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn_stronger_tt_property}
    \forall \sigma, i, c, \phi:\
    T_\sigma, c \not\models \neg\E_i\phi
    \implies
    L(\sigma), c \models \E_i\phi.
\end{equation}
\cref{eqn_stronger_tt_property} implies \credulity{}
in the presence of \soundness{}, and is thus a sufficient condition for
truth-tracking (when also taken with \equivalence{} and
\repetition{}).\footnotemark{}

\footnotetext{
    We conjecture \cref{eqn_stronger_tt_property} is strictly stronger than
    \credulity{}.
}

\cref{thm_tt_characterisation} also shows truth-tracking cannot be performed
\emph{deductively}: the method $L(\sigma) = \Xsnd_\sigma$, which does not go
beyond the mere information that each report is sound, fails \credulity{}. Some
amount of \emph{inductive} or \emph{non-monotonic} reasoning, as captured by
\credulity{}, is necessary.

The rest of this section works towards the proof of
\cref{thm_tt_characterisation}. We collect some useful properties of
psuedo-streams. First, psuedo-streams provide a way of accessing $Q^*$ via a
finite sequence: $T_\sigma$ is a cell in $Q^*$ whenever it is non-empty.

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lemma_tsigma_qstar}
    If $W \in T_\sigma$, then
    \begin{inlinelist}
        \item\label{item_ps_upperset} $W' \in \Xsnd_\sigma$ iff $W \specleq
            W'$; and
        \item\label{item_tsigma_qstar} $T_\sigma = Q^*[W]$.
    \end{inlinelist}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}

    Suppose $W \in T_\sigma$. For \cref{item_ps_upperset}, first suppose $W'
    \in \Xsnd_\sigma$ and $W, c \models \S_i\phi$.  Considering the singleton
    sequence $\delta = \tuple{i, c, \phi}$ we have $W \in \Xsnd_\delta$. From
    $W \in T_\sigma$ we get $\delta \seqss \sigma$, i.e. there is $\psi \equiv
    \phi$ such that $\tuple{i, c, \psi} \in \sigma$. From $W' \in \Xsnd_\sigma$
    and $\S_i\phi \equiv \S_i\psi$ we get $W', c \models \S_i\phi$.  This shows
    $W \specleq W'$.

    Now suppose $W \specleq W'$ and let $\tuple{i, c, \phi} \in \sigma$. Then
    since $W \in T_\sigma \subseteq \Xsnd_\sigma$ we have $W, c \models
    \S_i\phi$, and $W \specleq W'$ gives $W', c \models \S_i\phi$. Consequently
    $W' \in \Xsnd_\sigma$.

    Now for \cref{item_tsigma_qstar}, first suppose $W' \in Q^*[W]$. Then $W$
    and $W'$ satisfy exactly the same soundness statements, so $W' \in
    T_\sigma$ also.
    %
    Conversely, suppose $W' \in T_\sigma$. Then $W' \in \Xsnd_\sigma$, so
    \cref{item_ps_upperset} gives $W \specleq W'$.  But we also have $W' \in
    T_\sigma$ and $W \in \Xsnd_\sigma$, so \cref{item_ps_upperset} again gives
    $W' \specleq W$. Hence $W \speceq W'$, i.e. $W' \in Q^*[W]$.
\end{proof}

The next two results show that initial segments of streams are (eventually)
psuedo-streams, and that any psuedo-stream gives rise to a stream.

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lemma_stream_to_pseudostream}
    If $\rho$ is a stream for $W$, there is $n$ such that $W \in T_{\rho[m]}$
    for all $m \ge n$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}

    Let $\repr{\cdot}$ be a function which selects a representative formula for
    each equivalence class of $\Lprop / {\equiv}$, so that $\phi \equiv
    \repr{\phi}$ and $\phi \equiv \psi$ implies $\repr{\phi}$ is equal to
    $\repr{\psi}$. Note that since $\propvars$ is finite, and since $\srcs$ and
    $\css$ are also finite, there are only finitely many reports of the form
    $\tuple{i, c, \repr{\phi}}$. By completeness of $\rho$ for $W$, we may take
    $n$ sufficiently large so that $W, c \models \S_i{\repr{\phi}}$ implies
    $\tuple{i, c, \repr{\phi}} \in \rho[n]$, for all $i, c, \phi$.
    %
    Now, take $m \ge n$. We need to show $W \in T_{\rho[m]}$. Clearly $W \in
    \Xsnd_{\rho[m]}$, since $\rho$ is sound for $W$. Suppose $W \in
    \Xsnd_\delta$. We need to show $\delta \seqss \rho[m]$. Indeed, take
    $\tuple{i, c, \phi} \in \delta$. Then $W, c \models \S_i\phi$. Since
    $\S_i\phi \equiv \S_i{\repr{\phi}}$, we have $W, c \models
    \S_i{\repr{\phi}}$. Hence $\tuple{i, c, \repr{\phi}}$ appears in $\rho[n]$,
    and consequently in $\rho[m]$ too. Since $\phi \equiv \repr{\phi}$, this
    shows $\delta \seqss \rho[m]$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lemma_pseudostream_to_stream}
    If $W \in T_\sigma$ and $N = |\sigma|$, there is a stream $\rho$ for $W$
    such that $\rho[Nk] \equiv \sigma^k$ for all $k \in \N$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}

    First note that $W \in T_\sigma$ implies $\sigma \ne \emptyset$, so $N >
    0$. Since $\Lprop$ is countable, we may index the set of $\Lprop$ formulas
    equivalent to $\phi \in \Lprop$ as $\{\phi_n\}_{n \in \N}$. Let $\sigma_n$
    be obtained from $\sigma$ by replacing each report $\tuple{i, c, \phi}$
    with $\tuple{i, c, \phi_n}$. Then $\sigma \equiv \sigma_n$.
    %
    Let $\rho$ be the sequence obtained as the infinite concatenation $\sigma_1
    \seqappend \sigma_2 \seqappend \sigma_3 \seqappend \cdots$ (this is
    possible since $\sigma$ is of positive finite length). Then $\rho[Nk] =
    \sigma_1 \seqappend \cdots \seqappend \sigma_k$, and consequently $\rho[Nk]
    \equiv \sigma^k$.

    It remains to show $\rho$ is a stream for $W$. Soundness of $\rho$ follows
    from $W \in T_\sigma \subseteq \Xsnd_\sigma$, since every report in $\rho$
    is equivalent to some report in $\sigma$ by construction. For completeness,
    suppose $W, c \models \S_i\phi$. As in the proof of
    \cref{lemma_tsigma_qstar}, considering the singleton sequence $\delta =
    \tuple{i, c, \phi}$, we get from $W \in T_\sigma$ that there is $\psi
    \equiv \phi$ such that $\tuple{i, c, \psi} \in \sigma$. Hence there is $n
    \in \N$ such that $\phi = \psi_n$, so $\tuple{i, c, \phi} \in \sigma_n$,
    and thus $\tuple{i, c, \phi} \in \rho$.
\end{proof}

Next we obtain an equivalent formulation of
\credulity{} which is less transparent as a
postulate for learning methods, but easier to work with.

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lemma_equivalent_tt_property}
    Suppose $L$ satisfies \soundness{}. Then $L$ satisfies
    \credulity{} if and only if $L(\sigma) \subseteq
    T_\sigma$ for all $\sigma$ with $T_\sigma \ne \emptyset$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}

    ``if": Suppose $T_\sigma, c \not\models \S_i\phi$. Then there is $W \in
    T_\sigma$ such that $W, c \not\models \S_i\phi$. By our assumption and
    \cref{lemma_tsigma_qstar}, $L(\sigma) \subseteq T_\sigma = Q^*[W]$. Thus
    every world in $L(\sigma)$ agrees with $W$ on soundness statements, so
    $L(\sigma), c \models \neg\S_i\phi$.

    ``only if": Suppose there is some $W \in T_\sigma$, and take $W' \in
    L(\sigma)$. We need to show $W' \in T_\sigma$; by
    \cref{lemma_tsigma_qstar}, this is equivalent to $W \speceq W'$.
    %
    First suppose $W, c \models \S_i\phi$. Then $W \in T_\sigma$ implies there
    is $\psi \equiv \phi$ such that $\tuple{i, c, \psi} \in \sigma$. By
    \soundness{} for $L$, we have $W' \in L(\sigma) \subseteq \Xsnd_\sigma$.
    Consequently $W', c \models \S_i\psi$ and thus $W', c \models \S_i\phi$.
    This shows $W \specleq W'$.
    %
    Now suppose $W, c \not\models \S_i\phi$. Then $T_\sigma, c \not\models
    \S_i\phi$. By \credulity{}, $L(\sigma), c
    \models \neg\S_i\phi$. Hence $W', c \not\models \S_i\phi$. This shows $W'
    \specleq W$. Thus $W \speceq W'$ as required.
\end{proof}

Finally, we prove the characterisation of truth-tracking.

\begin{proof}[Proof of \cref{thm_tt_characterisation}]
    Suppose $L$ satisfies \equivalence{}, \repetition{} and \soundness{}.

    ``if": Suppose \credulity{} holds. We show $L$
    solves $Q^*$. Take any world $W$ and stream $\rho$ for $W$.  By
    \cref{lemma_stream_to_pseudostream}, there is $n$ such that $W \in
    T_{\rho[m]}$ for all $m \ge n$. By \cref{lemma_tsigma_qstar}, $T_{\rho[m]}
    = Q^*[W]$ for such $m$. In particular, $T_{\rho[m]} \ne \emptyset$.  By
    \credulity{} and
    \cref{lemma_equivalent_tt_property}, we get $L(\rho[m]) \subseteq
    T_{\rho[m]} = Q^*[W]$.

    ``only if": Suppose $L$ solves $Q^*$. We show
    \credulity{} via
    \cref{lemma_equivalent_tt_property}. Suppose there is some $W \in
    T_\sigma$, and write $N = |\sigma| > 0$. By
    \cref{lemma_pseudostream_to_stream}, there is a stream $\rho$ for $W$ such
    that $\rho[Nk] \equiv \sigma^k$ for all $k \in \N$. By \repetition{} and
    \equivalence{}, $L(\sigma) = L(\sigma^k) = L(\rho[Nk])$. But $L$ solves
    $Q^*$, so for $k$ sufficiently large we have $L(\rho[Nk]) \subseteq Q^*[W]
    = T_\sigma$. Hence, going via some large $k$, we obtain $L(\sigma)
    \subseteq T_\sigma$ as required.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Conditioning Methods}

In this section we turn to the family of \emph{conditioning} methods, proposed
in \cite{singleton_booth_22_preprint} and inspired by similar methods in the
belief change literature~\cite{spohn1988ordinal}.
% These methods were originally proposed in relation to \emph{rationality
% postulates} for a belief change problem with non-expert sources. By studying
% them in relation to truth-tracking, we will see that rationality is compatible
% with truth-tracking.
While our interpretation of input sequences is different -- we read $\tuple{i,
c, \phi}$ as $i$ reporting $\phi$ is \emph{possible} in case $c$, whereas
\textcite{singleton_booth_22_preprint} read this as $i$ \emph{believes} $\phi$ --
this class of methods can still be applied in our setting.

Conditioning methods operate by successively restricting a fixed
\emph{plausibility total preorder}\footnote{A total preorder is a reflexive,
transitive and total relation.} to the information corresponding to each
new report $\tuple{i, c, \phi}$. In this chapter, we take a report $\tuple{i, c,
\phi}$ to correspond to the fact that $\S_i\phi$ holds in case $c$; this fits
with our assumption throughout that sources only report sound
statements.\footnote{\textcite{singleton_booth_22_preprint} consider more general
conditioning methods in which this choice is not fixed.} Thus, the worlds under
consideration given a sequence $\sigma$ are exactly those satisfying all
soundness statements in $\sigma$, i.e. $\Xsnd_\sigma$. Note that $\Xsnd_\sigma$
represents the \emph{indefeasible knowledge} given by $\sigma$: worlds outside
$\Xsnd_\sigma$ are eliminated and cannot be recovered with further reports,
since $\Xsnd_{\sigma \seqappend \delta} \subseteq \Xsnd_\sigma$. The
plausibility order allows us to represent \emph{defeasible beliefs} about the
most plausible worlds within $\Xsnd_\sigma$.

\begin{definition}
    \label{def_conditioning_method}
    For a total preorder $\le$ on $\worlds$, the \emph{conditioning method}
    $L_{\le}$ is given by $L_{\le}(\sigma) = \min_{\le}{\Xsnd_\sigma}$.
\end{definition}

Note that since $\Xsnd_\sigma \ne \emptyset$ for all $\sigma$\footnotemark{}
and $\worlds$ is finite, $L_{\le}$ is consistent. Moreover, $L_{\le}$ satisfies
\equivalence{}, \repetition{} and \soundness{}.

\footnotetext{
    For example, if $\Pi^W_i = \{\vals\}$ for all $i$ then $W \in \Xsnd_\sigma$
    for all $\sigma$.
}

\begin{example}
    \label{ex_conditioning_operators}
    We recall two concrete choices of $\le$ from

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Set $W \le W'$ iff $r(W) \le r(W')$, where

              The most plausible worlds in this order are those in which
              source have as much expertise on the propositional variables as
              possible, on aggregate. We denote the corresponding conditioning
              method by $L_\vbc{}$, standing for \emph{variable-based
              conditioning}.

        \item Set $W \le W'$ iff $r(W) \le r(W')$, where

              This order aims to maximise the number of cells in each source's
              partitions, thereby maximising the number of propositions on
              which they have expertise. Note that the propositional variables
              play no special role. We denote the corresponding conditioning
              operator by $L_\pbc{}$, for \emph{partition-based conditioning}.
    \end{enumerate}

\end{example}

A straightforward property of $\le$ characterises truth-tracking for
conditioning methods. For a generic total preorder $\le$, let $<$ denote its
strict part.

\begin{theorem}
    \label{thm_conditioning_tt_characterisation}
    $L_{\le}$ is truth-tracking if and only if
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq_conditioning_tt_characterisation}
        W \speclt W'
            \implies
                \exists W'' \speceq W \text{ such that }
                    W'' < W'.
    \end{equation}
\end{theorem}

Like \credulity{}, \cref{eq_conditioning_tt_characterisation} is a principle of
maximising trust in sources. Recall from that \cref{lemma_spec_active_cell}
that $W \speclt W'$ means all sources are more knowledgeable in each case in
$W$ than in $W'$, and there is at least one source and case for which this
holds strictly. If we aim to trust sources as much as possible, we might impose
$W < W'$ here; then $W'$ is strictly less plausible and will be ruled out in
favour of $W$.  This yields a sufficient condition for truth-tracking, but to
obtain a necessary condition we need to allow a ``surrogate" world $W'' \speceq
W$ to take the place of $W$.

\begin{proof}[Proof of \cref{thm_conditioning_tt_characterisation}]
    Write $L = L_{\le}$. Since $L$ satisfies \equivalence{}, \repetition{} and
    \soundness{}, we may use \cref{thm_tt_characterisation}. Furthermore, it is
    sufficient by \cref{lemma_equivalent_tt_property} to show that
    \cref{eq_conditioning_tt_characterisation} holds if and only if $L(\sigma)
    \subseteq T_\sigma$, whenever $T_\sigma \ne \emptyset$.

    ``if": Suppose $W \speclt W'$. Let $\sigma$ be some pseudo-stream for $W$,
    so that $W \in T_\sigma$.\footnotemark{} Note that since $W \in T_\sigma
    \subseteq \Xsnd_\sigma$ and $W \speclt W'$, we have $W' \in \Xsnd_\sigma$
    also. By assumption, $L(\sigma) \subseteq T_\sigma = Q^*[W]$. Since $W
    \not\speceq W'$, this means $W' \in \Xsnd_\sigma \setminus L(\sigma)$. That
    is, $W'$ lies in $\Xsnd_\sigma$ but is not $\le$-minimal. Consequently
    there is $W'' \in \Xsnd_\sigma$ such that $W'' < W'$. Since $L$ is
    consistent, we may assume without loss of generality that $W'' \in
    L(\sigma)$. Hence $W'' \in Q^*[W]$, so $W'' \speceq W$.

    \footnotetext{
        For example, pick some stream $\rho$ and apply
        \cref{lemma_stream_to_pseudostream} to obtain a pseudo-stream.
    }

    ``only if": Suppose there is some $W \in T_\sigma$, and let $W' \in
    L(\sigma)$. We need to show $W' \in T_\sigma = Q^*[W]$, i.e. $W \speceq
    W'$. Since $W' \in L(\sigma) \subseteq \Xsnd_\sigma$,
    \cref{lemma_tsigma_qstar} gives $W \specleq W'$. Suppose for contradiction
    that $W \not\speceq W'$. Then $W \speclt W'$. By
    \cref{eq_conditioning_tt_characterisation}, there is $W'' \speceq W$ such
    that $W'' < W'$. But $W'$ is $\le$-minimal in $\Xsnd_\sigma$, so this must
    mean $W'' \notin \Xsnd_\sigma$. On the other hand, $W'' \in Q^*[W] =
    T_\sigma \subseteq \Xsnd_\sigma$: contradiction.
\end{proof}

    \label{fig_vbc_counterexample}
\end{figure}

\begin{example}
    We revisit the methods of \cref{ex_conditioning_operators}.

    \begin{enumerate}

        \item The variable-based conditioning method $L_\vbc{}$ is \emph{not}
              truth-tracking. Indeed, consider the worlds $W$ and $W'$ shown in
              \cref{fig_vbc_counterexample}, where we assume $\propvars = \{p,
              q\}$, $\srcs = \{i\}$ and $\css = \{c\}$. Then $W \speclt W'$
              (e.g. by \cref{lemma_spec_active_cell}).
              Note that $i$ does not have expertise on $p$ or $q$ in both $W$
              and $W'$, so $r(W) = r(W') = 0$. Moreover, $i$'s partition is
              uniquely determined in $Q^*[W]$ by
              \cref{thm_qstar_unique_ipartition_conditions}, so if $W'' \speceq
              W$ then $r(W'') = 0$ also. That is, there is no $W'' \speceq W$
              such that $W'' < W'$. Hence
              \cref{eq_conditioning_tt_characterisation} fails, and $L_\vbc{}$
              is not truth-tracking.
                %
              Intuitively, the problem here is that since $i$'s expertise is
              not split along the lines of the propositional variables when $W$
              is the actual world, $L_\vbc{}$ will always maintain $W'$ as a
              possibility.

          \item The partition-based conditioning method $L_\pbc{}$ \emph{is}
                truth-tracking. Indeed, if $W \speclt W'$ we may construct
                $W''$ from $W$ by modifying the partition of each source $i$ so
                that all valuations outside of $\bigcup_{c \in
                \css}{\Pi^W_i[v^W_c]}$ lie in their own cell.
                Then $W \speceq W''$. One can show that $\Pi^{W''}_i$ refines
                $\Pi^{W'}_i$ for all $i \in \srcs$, and there is some $i$ for
                which the refinement is strict. Hence the partitions in $W''$
                contain strictly more cells, so $W'' < W'$.

    \end{enumerate}

\end{example}

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec_conclusion}

\paragraph{Summary.}

In this chapter we studied truth-tracking in the presence of non-expert sources.
The model assumes sources report everything true \emph{up to their lack of
expertise}, i.e. all that they consider possible. We obtained precise
characterisations of when truth-tracking methods can uniquely find the
valuations and partitions of a world $W$. We then gave a postulational
characterisation of truth-tracking methods under mild assumptions, before looking
specifically at the conditioning methods of
\textcite{singleton_booth_22_preprint}.

\paragraph{Limitations and future work.}

Conceptually, the assumption that streams are complete is very strong. As seen
in \cref{ex_stream}, completeness requires sources to give jointly inconsistent
reports whenever $\Pi_i[v_c]$ contains more than just $v_c$. Such reports
provide information about the source's expertise: if $i$ reports both $\phi$
and $\neg\phi$ we know $\neg\E_i\phi$. To provide all sound reports sources
must also have \emph{negative introspection} over their own knowledge, i.e.
they \emph{know} when they do not know something. Indeed, our use of partitions
makes expertise closely related to S5
knowledge~\cite{singleton_booth_22_preprint,singleton2021logic}, which has been
criticised in the philosophical literature as too strong.
%
In reality, non-expert sources may have \emph{beliefs} about the world, and may
prefer to report only that which they believe. A source may even believe a
sound report $\phi$ is \emph{false}, since soundness only says the source does
not \emph{know} $\neg\phi$. For example, in \cref{ex_informal_example} the
doctor $\dr{}$ may think it is more likely that $\patientA{}$ suffers from $p$
than $q$, but we cannot express this in our framework.

On the technical side, our results on solvability of $Q^*$ and the
characterisation of \cref{thm_tt_characterisation} rely on the fact that we
only consider finitely many worlds. In a sense this trivialises the problem of
induction as studied by \textcite{kelly1997reliable,Baltag_2016}, among others. In
future work it would be interesting to see which results can be carried over to
the case where $\propvars$ is infinite.
