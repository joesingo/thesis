This thesis has studied topics surrounding trustworthiness and expertise.
\cref{conc_tab_themes} shows a rough overview of the different themes tackled
in each chapter. We now reflect chapter-by-chapter on these themes in more
detail, and discuss the connections between chapters.

In \cref{chapter_td} we took a social choice perspective on truth discovery.
Truth discovery concerns aggregating reports from unreliable sources, and
assessing their trustworthiness in the process. The representation of
information was simple in this chapter: we considered a number of ``objects''
of interest, each of which takes categorical values.  Trustworthiness was
expressed via a ranking of the sources, allowing us to say when one source
should be considered \emph{more trustworthy} than another. We would later take
a different approach in \cref{chapter_belief_change}, with information
represented by propositional formulas and with expertise-based semantics for
trustworthiness. However, the open-ended nature of ranking-based
trustworthiness without precise semantics allowed us to define several truth
discovery methods from the literature in our framework. Most importantly,
\cref{chapter_td} introduced several \emph{axioms} for truth discovery. We
proved the first impossibility results for truth discovery; this showed there
are fundamental constraints on which properties one can hope for when
constructing new truth discovery methods. The axioms highlighted a possible
problem with Sums -- a well known method introduced by
\textcite{pasternack2010} -- in its failure of \disjointindependence{}. This
led us to define a new method, called UnboundedSums, which modifies Sums to
resolve this axiomatic failure.

\cref{chapter_bipartite_tournaments} stayed with the social choice methodology,
this time applied to bipartite tournament ranking. This problem was motivated
by truth discovery -- in particular, by semi-supervised truth discovery -- and
also relates to assessing trustworthiness of sources. Concretely, bipartite
tournaments naturally model situations where the performance of sources on a
number of ``ground truth'' objects is known in advance. One can then use
bipartite tournament ranking methods to rank the sources by trustworthiness
(with respect to the ground truth) and the objects by difficulty. But in fact,
we gave several other example domains where bipartite tournaments provide a
natural model, such as education and solo sports. We therefore took a more
general view throughout the chapter and considered \emph{abstract} bipartite
tournaments, where no fixed interpretation was assigned to the players involved
or the nature of the matches between them. The overall approach was again
axiomatic.  We introduced several axioms; some adaptations of standard social
choice ideas and some specific to bipartite tournaments (e.g. \dualaxiom). We
also paid special attention to the class of \emph{chain-minimal} operators, the
ranking operators associated with the graph modification problem of \emph{chain
editing}. Such operators were rationalised by a result showing them to be
maximum likelihood estimators in a particular probabilistic model. In a sense
this is a truth-tracking result: chain-minimal operators find the ``true''
strengths of the tournament participants, if one accepts the assumptions of the
probabilistic model. However, this is a different sense of truth-tracking as
studied in \cref{chapter_truthtracking}, which refers to finding true
\emph{information} when given conflicting reports.
