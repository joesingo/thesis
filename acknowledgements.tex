I would like to first thank my supervisor Dr.\ Richard Booth for his enthusiasm
and guidance throughout this project. It's been a real pleasure to work
together. I thank my parents Lucy and Stephen for their continued support, and
my brother Ivan for helping me practise my conference talks. I'd like to also
thank my fellow students at Cardiff -- especially my office-mates Aric and
Mohammed -- for their company as I wrote this thesis. Finally, thanks to Scott
for being here throughout.
